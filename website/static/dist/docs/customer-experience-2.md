Whenever a new task is created on Arrivy it returns two IDS. One of them is the unique url_safe_id. Prepending this url id with `https://www.arrivy.com/live/track/<company_name>/<url_safe_id>` loads the hosted Arrivy experience. By default, all outbound sms and email notifications to the customer include this link. This view can also be hosted inside an iframe if needed.

For our enterprise customers, we provide customizations to this view so feel free to reach us at support@arrivy.com with your inquiries.

The following example demonstrates how the live track experience of the customer is built when a new task is created. The experience is completely hosted by arrivy and the URL to this experience is shared in each outbound sms & email to the customer.
