Team members in the field can use Arrivy’s mobile apps to communicate status and log information germane to the job. Arrivy has both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arrivy/id1177367972?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.insac.can.pinthatpoint&hl=en_US) apps and support phone and tablet form factors. While the apps can be installed directly from the Apple App Store and from Android Play, the easiest way to get them on crew devices is for the Scheduler or Arrivy Admin to “create” a crew member within Arrivy. This can be done via the Web Portal or Entities Create API as explained before. The service will automatically generate an email invite with a link on where/how to download and install the app.
