This guide will help you get started with Arrivy’s API. Arrivy's REST API provides tooling for real-time coordination of service calls and deliveries and is designed to help keep all parties in sync including your customers, field team, and office staff. At a high level, Arrivy APIs can help power the following:

- UBER-ize your customer experience
- Build a Live Service Tracker in few minutes
- Automate communications for customers and internal staff
- Enable field crew to see assignments in real-time and report progress
- Light up real-time dashboard and activity streams for support teams, schedulers, and dispatchers
- Provide intelligent prediction and alerting for job completion


> Arrivy connects businesses and its customers in real-time and engages them through the last mile.

**Base URL**
Arrivy's Sandbox environment for development and testing makes it easy to try out your integrations without risking production data. Depending on the environment, one of the following base URLs can be used to make API calls.

```bash
https://www.arrivy.com/api
https://sandbox.arrivy.com/api
```

To leverage the sandbox environment, you will need to sign up for a sandbox account at [https://sandbox.arrivy.com](https://sandbox.arrivy.com). This account is kept completely separate from your production account and it's free.

This Developer’s portal will walk you through all the details of integration. But first, we’ll describe the key concepts of Arrivy eco-system. If you have questions about the API, want to share some feedback or want to report a bug, send an email to [support@arrivy.com](mailto:support@arrivy.com).
