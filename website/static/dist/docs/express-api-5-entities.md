> You can create entities by going to **Team Tab** on Arrivy Web Portal. Read more about this on [Arrivy Help](https://help.arrivy.com/team-equipment). We understand for most enterprises this isn't manageable so we provide the API access for Entities.

As mentioned earlier, an Entity can be a service tech, delivery person or crew member.

Once you create an entity you will be able to assign tasks and get progress information. Also, reporting and fetching location information in real-time is super simple. There is no limit on the number of **entities** one can create under an Arrivy Account. Also, if you happen to have groups within your company Arrivy supports that too. Please refer to the groups help and API reference.

#### What happens when a new entity is created?
- Invite goes out to the entity to create a login account with appropriate permissions or you can automatically pre-configure a login account for this Entity by passing appropriate parameters to entities create API. This helps when you are planning to use Arrivy Mobile apps.
- They can login on Arrivy Mobile Apps
- You can assign tasks and get progress via APIs or Arrivy Mobile apps
