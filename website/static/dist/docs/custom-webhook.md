> Webhooks notify external application with updates from Arrivy

Arrivy webhooks send HTTP POST notifications to external applications for any task related events that happen on Arrivy. The source of these events could be the end customer, field crew, web user and in some cases Arrivy System itself. The end-point for your service to receive the webhook notifications can be easily configured in Arrivy portal under Settings -> Integrations & Basic Settings.

Following are some of the events that trigger webhook notifications:
- Task created, updated, assigned, rescheduled etc.
- Status update on a task (e.g. ENROUTE, START, COMPLETE, EXCEPTION, Crew Arriving, Items Delivered etc.)
- Delays and no shows
- A new note from a customer
- A customer left a rating

### Payload
The payload of the event is a JSON structure that contains the following properties:

|Attributes|Details
|---|
| **EVENT_TYPE**<br/>*string* |Type of the event e.g. TASK_CREATED, TASK_STATUS, TASK_RATING etc. All the possible event types are listed in a table below.
| **REPORTER_ID**<br/>*integer* |ID of the reporter. Typically this is the Arrivy ID of the Entity (aka driver). If the value is '0' it indicates that this event is generated by Arrivy itself e.g. LATE, NOSHOW etc. In case this event was fired as a result of a customer activity (e.g. new note and new rating) then the provided customer_id on the task will be returned here. You can check the flag response_from_customer to see if it is a customer activity or not.
| **REPORTER_NAME**<br/>*string* |Name of the event reporter
| **RESPONSE_FROM_CUSTOMER**<br/>*boolean* | True when this event originates from a customer action e.g. customer left a new rating or responded to Arrivy-generated emails, SMS texts and messages posted through the Task Journal (shown on the customerâ€™s Live Track page)
| **TITLE**<br/>*string*  | Brief summary of the event
| **MESSAGE**<br/>*string*  | Text description of the event
| **OBJECT_TYPE**<br/>*string* | Indicates the arrivy object type that was modified, added or deleted as a result of this event. This is always TASK and you can safely ignore this value for now. We will be introducing new types here.
| **OBJECT_ID**<br/>*integer* | Arrivy ID of the task that this event is related to.
| **OBJECT_EXTERNAL_ID**<br/>*string* | If an external ID for this Arrivy task is supplied 
| **OBJECT_DATE**<br/>*string* | Scheduled start datetime of the task if available
| **EXTRA_FIELDS**<br/>*object* | Key-value pairs. We append all extra_fields that were recorded on the task and the task status in this object. This is useful as you can send any fields for correlation in your task and these will be supplied in the webhook payload for all activities on that task. 
| **HAS_ATTACHMENT**<br/>*boolean* | Indicates whether there are any attachments in this event e.g. A picture was attached by a customer or a crew member
| **ITEMS**<br/>*object* | List of all items along with their reported status (DELIVERED, REJECTED, PICKED_UP) that were recorded at the time of reporting a particular status of type `ORDER`. Otherwise, it will be null.
| **IS_TRANSIENT_STATUS**<br/>*boolean* | True indicates that this event is transient and will be removed/changed after some time. One of the examples is a status of type AUTO_START_PENDING which is removed when the task is marked START manually (or AUTO_START happens).
| **OBJECT_GROUP_ID**<br/>*integer* |Arrivy ID of the group associated with the task
| **EVENT_ID**<br/>*integer* | Unique identifier for this event
| **EVENT_TIME**<br/>*string* | Time of the event in UTC. ISO 8601.
| **EXCEPTION**<br/>*object* | An object containing the details of an exception which was added while reporting CANCELLED, EXCEPTION or SKIP type task status.

> If you intend to NOT receive push notification for a specific event please pass the optional flag `do_not_send_webhook_notification` as True in the body of POST or PUT request and as a query param in DELETE request.

We are planning to provide the capability to send only those webhook events that are interesting for our customers. Before that happens, please implement filtering at your end.
