**Base URL**
Arrivy's Sandbox environment for development and testing makes it easy to try out your integrations without risking production data. Depending on the environment, one of the following base URLs can be used to make API calls.

```bash
https://www.arrivy.com/api
https://sandbox.arrivy.com/api
```

To leverage the sandbox environment, you will need to sign up for a sandbox account at [https://sandbox.arrivy.com](https://sandbox.arrivy.com). This account is kept completely separate from your production account and it's free.

This Developer’s portal will walk you through all the details of integration. But first, we’ll describe the key concepts of Arrivy eco-system. If you have questions about the API, want to share some feedback or want to report a bug, send an email to [support@arrivy.com](mailto:support@arrivy.com).
