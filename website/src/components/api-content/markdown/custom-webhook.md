## Custom Webhook

> This functionality provides the facility of receiving a generic payload against the events being done on ARRIVY, to your custom webhook. If you intend to not receive push notification for a specific event please pass the optional flag 'do_not_send_webhook_notification' as True in the body of that respective request.

ARRIVY will POST a generic payload against following events:
## Events for Custom Webhook

| Task create,delete,reschedule and delay (Late/No Show) |
| Task Update (Crew assigned/removed, Equipment assigned/removed) |
| Task Rating create |
